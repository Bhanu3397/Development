#About 'while' loops

'''When you write code, one common challenge is to have it perform a task an unknown number of times. In this unit, you want to allow a user to enter a list of planet names. Unfortunately, you don't know how many names the user will enter. To support looping an unknown number of times, you can use a while loop.

A while loop performs an operation while a certain condition is true. You could look to see if there's another line in a file, a flag has been set, a user has finished entering values, or something else has changed to indicate that the code can stop performing the operation.'''

'''The most important thing to remember when you create while loops is to ensure that the condition changes. If the condition is always true, Python will continue to run your code until the program crashes.'''

#Introducing Python dictionaries

'''Python uses curly braces ({ }) and the colon (:) to denote a dictionary. You can either create an empty dictionary and add values later, or populate it at creation time. Each key/value is separated by a colon, and the name of each key is contained in quotes as a string literal. Because the key is a string literal, you can use whatever name is appropriate to describe the value.'''

'''You have two keys, 'name' and 'moons'. Each of these behaves in much the same way as a variable: they have a unique name, and they store a value. However, they are contained inside of a single, larger variable, named planet.'''
